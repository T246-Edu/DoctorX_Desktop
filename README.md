# Disease Prediction Model (Malaria)


## Content:-
  >The dataset contains 2 folders - Infected and Uninfected with Training and Testing.

## Implementation
  Building an deep learning model to recognise cell images as Infected/Uninfected, Binary classification task. As a deep learning model I used convolution neural network as they perform great in fetching important information from images.

## Acknowledgements(Original):-
  This Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/ And uploaded here, so anybody trying to start working with this dataset can get started immediately, as to download the dataset from NIH website is quite slow.
